            <h3>PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
              When using the Xder Platforms, we collect Personal Data about you,
              most of which you provide voluntarily. We may also obtain data
              about your interactions, usage and experiences on our Platforms,
              as well as receive information from third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Data You Must Provide</strong>: When creating an
              account, you are required to provide a limited amount of Personal
              Data, such as an email address or phone number, along with your
              date of birth to verify that you are of legal age.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Data You May Provide</strong>: You are free to
              decide what Personal Data you wish to include in your “Xder
              Profile”. This Personal Profile Data, known as “Profile
              Information”, is shared with other users of the Xder Services,
              i.e. the “Xder Community”. This includes options like sharing your
              location, photos and videos. However, please note that omitting
              certain data could affect the functionality of some Xder Services.
              You can also choose whether to provide Personal Data to provide
              feedback, use customer services, or participate in surveys. The
              types of data collected may vary depending on the survey.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note on Sensitive Personal Data</strong>: In some
              jurisdictions and under certain regulations, Personal Data that
              may reveal a person’s racial or ethnic origin may be considered
              “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Notice About Location Information</strong>: We may collect
              your exact location (“Location”) to determine your distance from
              other users (“Distance Data”). Advanced users who use the Xder
              Services in an unauthorized manner or who change locations while
              you remain there may use Distance Information to determine your
              location and possibly your identity. You can choose to hide your
              distance information, but the Xder Services will still sort and
              display your profile based on your relative distance from other
              users. Even if you choose to hide this information, other people
              may still be able to determine your location. Additionally, you
              have the option to revoke this permission and disable location
              services on your device. On iPhone, you can do this from Settings
              &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services &gt; Xder, and on Android
              devices, from Settings &gt; Location &gt; Xder &gt; Location
              Permissions, adjusting your browser settings.

              Community and third parties in the context of our Platforms, as

                your location and other data with the Xder Community.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third Party Providers</strong>: Xder shares Personal
                Data with various third party providers in order to provide the
                to whom you may provide Personal Data directly (for example,
                Apple for chat backups and Stripe for payment processing).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Business Transactions</strong>: In the event that
                another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company,
                business or assets, such company will assume ownership of the
                Personal Data that we have collected and accept the rights and
                obligations related to that Personal Data, of in accordance with
                what is described in this Policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We reserve the right to
                access, retain and disclose Personal Data in situations
                involving: (i) compliance with the Xder Terms and Conditions of
                Service; (ii) allegations related to content or conduct that may
                violate our policies or the rights of third parties; (iii)
                customer service requests; (iv) technical problems; (v) the

                rights or defending against legal claims; (viii) tax and
                accounting implications; or (ix) any other cause required by
                law, collectively known as “Legal Obligations”.

            </ul>
            <h3 class="mb-0">&nbsp;</h3>
            <h3>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
            <p>
              We retain your Personal Data for as long as strictly necessary to
              fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as permitted by
              Legal Obligations, the Xder Terms and Conditions of Service, or
              the Xder Community Standards. Additionally, we retain a device
              identifier (IDFV and Android ID) and limited log data for a period
              of up to two years after account deletion, for the purpose of
              supporting internal reporting, analysis and statistics. In
              situations where there is a legal or security requirement,
              Personal Data may be retained for longer periods. For example,
              Xder may retain certain account information, a device identifier
              (VID and Android ID), and limited registration data for accounts
              that have been banned or that violate Xder’s Terms and Conditions
              of Service or Xder Community. In some circumstances, Xder may also
              retain chat messages used to report violating behavior that
              results in an account being banned.

              Local and Server Storage: Xder is implementing chat message
              storage on its servers to support the use of the Xder Services,
              including enhanced security features and an optimized user
              experience across multiple platforms and devices. This transition
              involves longer data retention, in accordance with our data
              retention policy. However, it is important to note that chat
              messages, including images and recordings, may continue to be
              stored locally on users’ devices and may persist on the
              recipient’s device, even after this information is no longer
              available on the Xder servers.

                  However, it excludes you from interest-based advertising, as

            <h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
            <p>
              At Xder, the security and privacy of your Personal Data is of
              utmost importance to us. We maintain a rigorous focus on the
              integrity, confidentiality and availability of your data,
              including information of a sensitive nature. Our cybersecurity
              team works continuously to strengthen our defenses and protect
              your Personal Data and any sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we use our best efforts to provide robust security and
              privacy features, it is important to note that no method of data
              transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely
              foolproof. Therefore, although we implement robust measures, we
              cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Data. Our
              security measures and privacy policies are provided “as is.”
              Consequently, we cannot ensure error-free effectiveness or
              absolute confidentiality and anonymity. We advise that if you have
              particular concerns about the protection of your data, you
              consider not using our Properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the unlikely event that we are required by law to inform you of
              unauthorized access to your Personal Data, we will notify you in
              accordance with applicable legal provisions, either by electronic
              means or by written communication. Your security and privacy are
              fundamental to us, and we are committed to continuing to improve
              our practices to safeguard your Personal Data.
