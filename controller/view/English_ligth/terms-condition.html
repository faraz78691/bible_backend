                >. Please read the following arbitration clause in this document
                carefully. Unless you opt out as set forth in Sections 12 and 13
                below, this arbitration provision requires you to resolve
                disputes with Xder through an arbitration process and restricts

                      You and Xder agree that any dispute that has arisen or may
                      arise between us in connection with your use of or access
                      to the Xder Services, any validity, interpretation,
                      breach, enforceability or termination of this Agreement or
                      otherwise relating to Xder ( collectively, “Covered
                      Dispute Matters” or “Disputes”) will be resolved in
                      accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section
                      22.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Informal resolution</strong>. You and Xder agree
                      that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes may
                      result in a quick, low-cost, and mutually beneficial
                      result. Therefore, you and , in a good faith effort to
                      informally resolve any Dispute covered by this arbitration
                      provision (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference” or
                      “Conference”). If You are represented by an attorney, Your
                      attorney may participate in the conference, but will also
                      participate in the conference. The party initiating a
                      Dispute must notify the other party in writing of its
                      intention to initiate a Conference (“Notice”), which will
                      occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party
                      receives such Notice, unless the parties mutually agree to
                      an extension. Notification to Xder that you intend to
                      initiate a conference must be sent by email to
                      <a href="mailto:legal@xder.com">legal@xder.com</a>. The
                      Notice must include: (1) Your name, telephone number,
                      postal address, and the email address associated with Your
                      User Account (if You have one); (2) the name, telephone
                      number, mailing address, and email address of Your
                      attorney, if applicable; and (3) a description of Your
                      Dispute. The Conference will be individualized so that a
                      separate Conference must be held each time either party
                      initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of
                      law firms represents multiple users in similar cases,
                      unless all parties agree; Multiple people who initiate a
                      Dispute cannot participate in the same Conference unless
                      all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving
                      the Notice and the Conference, nothing contained in this
                      arbitration provision shall prohibit the parties from
                      engaging in informal communications to resolve the
                      initiating party’s Dispute. Participating in the
                      Conference is a precondition and requirement that must be
                      met before the arbitration begins. The statute of
                      limitations and filing fee deadlines will be charged while
                      the parties participate in the Conference process required
                      by this section.

                      this provision and each of its parts evidence a
                      transaction involving interstate commerce, and the FAA
                      applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and
                      application of the arbitration rules and arbitration
                      procedures. Any Covered Dispute Issues must be asserted
                      individually in binding arbitration administered by the
                      American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance
                      with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (including the use of

                      appropriate and mitigation of travel costs) available at
                      the link to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. A party
                      who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other
                      party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The
                      Request must include (1) the name, telephone number,
                      mailing address, email address of the party requesting
                      arbitration and account username (if applicable), as well
                      as the email address associated with any applicable User
                      Account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being
                      asserted and the factual basis for such claims; (3) a
                      description of the remedy sought and a good faith estimate
                      of the amount in dispute in U.S. dollars; (4) a statement
                      certifying the completion of the Dispute Resolution
                      process regarding the information as set forth above; and
                      (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid the
                      required filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
                      If the party requesting arbitration is represented by an
                      attorney, the Request will also include the attorney’s
                      name, telephone number, mailing address, and email
                      address. That attorney must also sign the Application. By
                      signing the Application, the attorney certifies to the
                      best of the attorney’s knowledge, information, and
                      beliefs, formed after reasonable consultation in the
                      circumstances in which: (1) the Application is not
                      submitted for any improper purpose, such as harass, cause
                      unnecessary delay, or unnecessarily increase the cost of
                      resolving Disputes; (2) the claims, defenses, and other
                      legal arguments are warranted by existing law or by a
                      non-frivolous argument to extend, modify, or repeal
                      existing law or to establish new law; and (3) the facts
                      and damages have evidentiary support or, if specifically
                      identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a
                      reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
                      discovery. The arbitrator will be a retired judge or an
                      attorney licensed to practice law in the State of
                      California and will be selected by the parties from the
                      AAA’s list of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties
                      are unable to agree on an arbitrator within thirty-five
                      (35) days of delivery of the Request, the AAA will appoint
